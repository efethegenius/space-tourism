## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

I started developing from the mobile view, built the tablet layout and then worked my way up to the desktop layout

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

-Improved on aligning the website to fit multiple screensizes of the same device
-Improve in my transition smoothness and user experience
-Improved on using media queries
-Learnt how to use the mobile first workflow approach for development
-General alignment using positions (relative, absolute) along with top, lrft, right, bottom
-Improved on my ability to properly group elements in divs

```css
.img {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: flex-end;
  width: 69vw;
  height: 572px;
  margin-top: 30px;
  border-bottom: 0;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

-bottom:0 like above aligns the .img to the bottom nearest parent relative element (...to the parent if it is relative)

### Continued development

-Continued development on element alignments
-Properly naming classes
